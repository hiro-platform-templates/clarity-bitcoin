# Interact with Bitcoin using Clarity

This example demonstrates how to use Clarity to parse Bitcoin transactions and block headers and verify that transactions were sent on the blockchain.

## Know your Contract

The [clarity-bitcoin.clar](/examples/clarity-bitcoin/contracts/clarity-bitcoin.clar) contract includes the following functionality.

- `parse-tx (..)` function dives into how to parse a Bitcoin transaction and the expected return type for your use in your business logic
- `verify-block-header (...)` function unpacks the nuances of verifying a block header for a given block height
- `was-tx-mined-compact` and `was-segwit-tx-mined-compact` functions determines whether or not a Bitcoin transaction was mined in a previous Bitcoin block

To add new contracts, follow detailed instructions at [Add new Contract](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-add-contract).

> **NOTE**: To use this example with Clarinet inside [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so), you can open the terminal session inside VS code by navigating to File -> View -> Terminal.

## Test your Contract

- You can manually test your your contracts in the [Clarinet console](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract#load-contracts-in-a-console).
- You can programmatically test your contracts with [unit tests](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract).
